# First - Define paneldir as the project's root directory in your project's Rscript. 
# All other filepaths will be defined relative to this one.

# These two directories always reside in data_NFSPanelAnalysis project directory, no matter
# which project you're working on. Will always look for data_NFSPanelAnalysis one directory above paneldir
