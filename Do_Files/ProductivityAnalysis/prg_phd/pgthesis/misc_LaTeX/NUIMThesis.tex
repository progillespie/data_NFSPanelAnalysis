\chapter{Introduction}
LThis microphone explode, shattering The molds  Ya eighter drop tha hits like de la o or get tha Fuck 
off tha commode Wit tha sure shot, sure ta make tha  Bodies drop Drop an don’t copy yo, don’t call this
  A co-opt  Terror rains drenchin’, quenchin’ tha thirst of  Tha power dons  That five sided fist-a-gon  
Tha rotten sore on the face of mother earth gets Bigger  Tha triggers cold empty ya purse

This is a list, oh my god!

This is a second list item

\section{Overview of the report}
Section two is requirements, section three is design, four is implementation. And so on, you get the picture, don't you ?

\chapter{Requirements}
Latex might seem to make things complicated initially , but in the long term, it makes things simpler. You won't be convinced
of that until you see someone dragging and dropping pictures all over the place in Microsoft Word, or the way they spend hours
bolding, highlighting and aligning different things. Anyways, back to the learning. 


\chapter{Design}
This chapter discusses design and all the issues we had with it. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
This is a numbered list
\item
Whilst bullet lists are done with the itemize command , numbered ones are done with the enumerate command. 
\item
Katie Holmes
\item
Definitely Katie Holmes
\item
Definitely

\end{enumerate}
As you can see, enumerated lists have their own purposes, furthermore if you nest lists within lists, LaTeX sorts out fancy roman numerals and shit for you!
\chapter{Implementation}
This is were you discuss all the platform specific stuff, e.g. This was ran on Apach 1.3.1 , PHP is a shit language, if you were my student I would fail you for that alone.

%\label{fig:vish}
%\end{figure}
Anways, by looking at the source of this latex file, you can find out how to do every you need for a final year thesis. Durka Durka Durka, Mohammed Jihad. 
%Actually , we better refer to that pic, so Figure~\ref{fig:vish} shows vish in all his glory. If you are using the Gimp %(gimp.org) for converting your images, don't be afraid to 
%use its advanced color handling, and even apply a drop shadow. It looks nice. 


\chapter{The Travelling Salesman Problem}
This "problem" always bothered me, if you can't get your shit together to travel around a few towns in a logical manner, then did you ever think that the job aint for you?
\chapter{Testing}

Ah yes, testing chapter, This is probably the only chapter were you would be allowed go three headings deep. Lets do it shall we?
\section{White Box Testing}
We decided to break the system into sub components, enabling us to perform unit testing on each part. First off, is the login system
\subsection{The Login System}
There are only two outcomes from a login, accept or reject. We simulated intense stress testing by using a perl script to repetitively attempt to login, 
using random strings as username and password, and also using valid names/passwords on occasion. 
\subsubsection{Testing Successful Logins}
We tested them , they worked. 
\subsubsection{Testing Invalid Logins}
We tested them too , they also worked. Whats nice about this , is that if you check the generated table of contents, everything looks perfect, you don't have to 
worry about anything. 
\subsection{The search system}
Yeah yeah yeah , this is soo boring to type.
\section{Integration Testing}
This is when, after unit testing, you test that the sub components interact successfully with each other. 
\chapter{Conclusions}
Finally , I will show you how to do a table, and a reference. 
So, as you can see Des Traynor\cite{DesTraynor} showed us a thing or two. As a side note, always run the latex command twice to ensure your references
are proper. Its just a little thing that helps. 
\section{Table Time}
We all love tables, they are great for eating off, here is a table...
\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\begin{center}

\label{tab:football}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
\hline
$Year$&$Winner$\\
\hline
1995/6&Manchester United\\
1996/7&Manchester United\\
1997/8&Arsenal\\
1998/9&Manchester United\\
1999/00&Manchester United\\
2000/01&Manchester United\\
2001/02&Arsenal\\
2002/03&Manchester United\\
2003/04&Arsenal\\
2004/05&Manchester United\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Clearly United have won a thing or two.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tab:football} shows that Manchester United are clearly superior. End of story. Here is some more text. 
$What starts with e , ends with e and contains only one letter?$
