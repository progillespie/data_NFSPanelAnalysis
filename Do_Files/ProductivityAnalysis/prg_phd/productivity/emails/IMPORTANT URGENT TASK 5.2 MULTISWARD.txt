Subject: IMPORTANT URGENT TASK 5.2 MULTISWARD
Dear  Fiona and Cathal, 


I am writing the paper of task 5.2 on the socio-economic and political driving forces that are supporting the use of grasslands or, alternatively, are inducing the replacement of grasslands by annual crops. Present agricultural policies (after the CAP reform of 2003) will be evaluated for their impacts on those aspects.



There are actually very few information, very few scientific papers or reports on that subject and even statistical data are rare. That is why I am asking you your contribution for some elements.



I am looking for statistical data on the surface (ha) of:

- permanent grasslands

- temporary grasslands (grass, grass/legume or pure legume mixtures) that are part of the arable land area

- annual forage crops (forage maize, fodder beat and others)

- grazed common land or rangeland that are normally not a part of the utilized agricultural area of farms

- the total of arable land (without perennial crops like orchards or vineyards)

- the total agricultural area



and that in the period between 1960 and 2010. It would be nice to have data every 5 years: 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2009 (or the last available data). It is thus a total of 66 data.



In addition, I am looking for the conclusions of papers on the analysis of the effects on some policy programmes on grasslands in your country (surface, intensification/extensification, abandonment, conversion to crops, increase/decrease of profitability, increase/decrease of attractiveness compared to other land uses):



- decoupling of payments from production (it means notably the suppression of the ‘forage maize premium’)

- modulation  (transfer of budget from the first to the second pillar)

- introduction of cross-compliance including the protection of the permanent grassland area

partial re-nationalisation and the avoidance of encroachment of unwanted vegetation

- extension of the Rural Development Programme, including the development of the Agri-Environment Programme (AEP)

- ‘Health Check’:

-   abolishment of arable set-aside

-   gradual increase of milk quotas leading up to their abolition in 2015

-   the conversion of market intervention into a safety net. Market intervention (EU purchase of excess supply) will be used as a safety net when food prices are unsustainably low

-   increase of modulation for transferring direct payments to farmers to the Rural Development Fund (need to face new challenges and opportunities including climate change, the need for better water management, the conservation of biodiversity, and the production of green energy). 

-   Member States will also be able to assist farmers producing milk, beef, goat and sheep meat in disadvantaged regions or vulnerable types of farming

- EU enlargement

- Natura 2000

- Water Framework and Nitrate Directives



If you could comment, even briefly these points and their influence in your country, it would be very useful. Literature references will be useful too.



I would be pleased to receive the statistical data separately if you cannot do both things at the same time. Could you confirm that you could do this work and in which time interval? It is rather urgent of course!



Thanks in advance. This work is very important for the success of our project.



Best wishes

Alain
