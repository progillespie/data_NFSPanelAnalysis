WELCOME to Version 4.0 of NLOGIT and Version 9.0 of LIMDEP
NLOGIT Version 4.0, January 1, 2007.  
Written By William Greene and David Hensher
==================================================

To our users, new and previous:

NLOGIT 4.0 is an extension of LIMDEP 9.0 that contains all of LIMDEP 
plus the tools for discrete choice modeling that are documented in the 
NLOGIT Reference Guide.

Version 9.0 is our new version of LIMDEP.  This program contains nearly 
four years of development of new estimation programs, programming 
features and fine tuning of the operation of Version 8.0 of LIMDEP. The 
list of revisions of the program runs to nearly 50 pages of the manual.  
You will want to examine the chapter ‘What's New in Version 9.0’ in the 
new (and also greatly expanded) program manual.  This chapter appears 
at the beginning of the LIMDEP Reference Guide.

NLOGIT has also undergone extensive revision and development. There 
is a ‘What's New in Version 4.0’ chapter in the NLOGIT Reference Guide
that you should examine if you are a previous user of Version 3.0.

Please note:  There are no backwards incompatibilities that we are aware 
of in thrse programs.  Users of previous versions will be able to port all 
command and project files to Version 9.0 with no modification. 

Installation:  If you do not change the destination folder, your 
program will be installed in 

C:\Program Files\Econometric Software\NLOGIT4
