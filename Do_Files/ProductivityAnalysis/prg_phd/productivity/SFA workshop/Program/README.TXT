WELCOME to Version 8.0 of LIMDEP
--------------------------------

Version: 8.0
Written by: William Greene
August 1, 2002

To our users, new and previous.

This is our new revision of LIMDEP.  This program contains 
nearly three years of development of new estimation programs
programming features and fine tuning of the operation of 
Version 7.0 of LIMDEP. The list of revisions of the program 
runs to nearly 40 pages of the manual.  You will want to 
examine the chapter "What's New in Version 8.0" in the new 
(and also greatly expanded) program manual.  This chapter 
appears at the beginning of the Reference part of the 
documentation.

Please note:  There are no backwards incompatibilities that
we are aware of in this program.  Version 7.0 users will be
able to port all command and project files to Version 8.0 
with no modification.  Do note, however, that since you may
have up to 900 variables in a project in Version 8.0 and 
200 in 7.0, porting a project file from 8.0 to 7.0 will be
a problem if you have more than 200 variables.
