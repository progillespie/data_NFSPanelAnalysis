***** This file's purpose is to correct an error that prevented Stata from recognising the dta data sets in Task4/CountrySTATAFiles. It simply calls in the identical csv files and then overwrites the affected dta files. ***** If you do not experience this error, then you DO NOT NEED TO RUN this file. However, you might keep it in case you move to a different computer or operating system.clearforeach country in "Austria" "Belgium" "Bulgaria" "Cyprus" "CzechRepublic" "Denmark" "Estonia" "Finland" "France" "Germany" "Hungary" "Italy" "Latvia" "Lithuania" "Luxembourg" "Netherlands" "Poland" "Portugal" "Romania" "Slovakia" "Slovenia" "Spain" "Sweden" "UnitedKingdom" {cleardi "`country'"insheet using ../../CountryData/`country'.csvsave ../../CountrySTATAFiles/`country', replace}
