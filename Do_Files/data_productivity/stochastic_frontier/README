This is an attempt at unifying the various stages of setup 
required for running James Carroll's SFA models for the 
dairy sector up to 2009 (originally only up to 2006).

All the necessary files should be contained within this
directory. There are two main subdirectories:

"inputdata"  // files, subdir's, subsubdir's
"setup_code" // two files

They are self explanatory. 

- datamaker.do // takes you through initial data setup, 
                 ..... ultimately leaving you with a .csv file that must be
                 ..... opened in Excel and changed to an .xls extension for 
               
		 ..... reading into Limdep (a straightforward csv file 
                 ..... doesn't seem to work for some reason!!!) This is a 
                 ..... master file that calls the do files in setup_code.

- 9609v2d.lim // Runs the models in Limdep. 

- LCSF_check  // file used to validate results from the OK 
                 ..... model, before adding new years.

- Run datamaker.do, then open 9609v2d.csv in Excel, save as
                 ..... an xls file, then run 9609v2d.lim.
