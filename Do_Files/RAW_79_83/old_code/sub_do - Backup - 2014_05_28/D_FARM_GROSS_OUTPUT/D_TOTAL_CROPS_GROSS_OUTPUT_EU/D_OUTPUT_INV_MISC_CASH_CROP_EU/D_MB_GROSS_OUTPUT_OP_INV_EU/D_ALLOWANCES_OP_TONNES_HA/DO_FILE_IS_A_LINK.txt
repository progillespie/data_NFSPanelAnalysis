The do file in this directory is a "linking" do file. It's my solution to the following problem.


The same derived variable may be required by several variables, but duplicate do files (one for each
 variable that requires some derived variable) is dangerous and labour intensive if there are updates
 or corrections to variable definitions.  

It's far better to have a single do file deriving the variable, and to "link" to it where ever 
 necessary afterward. This way ensures consistency of definitions, preserves the informative 
 nature of the file structure, and reduces the alterations from the basic template for all of
 these do files. 

One drawback to this approach is that the location that the "link" files point to will have to 
 be updated if the do file is moved, so that should not be done lightly.
