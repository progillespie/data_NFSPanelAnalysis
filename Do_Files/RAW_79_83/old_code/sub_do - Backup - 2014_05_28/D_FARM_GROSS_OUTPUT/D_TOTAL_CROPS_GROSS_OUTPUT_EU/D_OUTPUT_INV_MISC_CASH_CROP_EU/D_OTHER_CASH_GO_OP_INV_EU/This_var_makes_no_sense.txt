* This equation makes no sense!
*  Talked to Brian Moran about it... he thinks its gone haywire too!
*   Says what's supposed to be happening, is that the costs of 
*   keeping an opening stock (drying mainly, but storage as well)
*   need to be subtracted from the value of opening stock, but 
*   that doesn't seem to be happening here.

* Spoke with Brian on the afternoon of 04/06/2014.
