DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE FROM THIS FOLDER!
BE SURE TO READ THE COMMENTS IN THE DO-FILES!


1: Master files control the whole analysis. All do files in 
    this project folder's root should be masters. 


2: The folder sub_do contains support files. Each has a 
    specific task, and they are intended to be called 
    by a master file. IN MANY CASES, RUNNING A FILE DIRECTLY
    FROM /sub_do WON'T WORK!


3: Update the CD command at the top of the relevant master 
    to point to this folder


4: You may rename the project folder where this file lives, 
    or any parent directory of it, but don't move/rename any 
    subfolders or files until you're comfortable with how 
    they work. Even then, create a copy beforehand. 


5: This project folder is not portable; it requires the data 
    stored in a subfolder with the same name as this one, but
    located in OrigData (two levels up). However, if you copy 
    both of these folders, and place them in your own OutData 
    and Do_Files folders, then the files should run, and they
    should create any other needed folders for you.
