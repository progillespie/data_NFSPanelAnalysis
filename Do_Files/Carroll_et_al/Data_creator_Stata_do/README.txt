These files are set up files for the files in
    code_NLogit/Limdep files (Carroll et al)
and/or any other NLogit files which were based on these.

They take as input a NFS data file (or one that's made to look like it) 
and then manipulate that data in such a way as to allow Carroll et al's
NLogit/Limdep files to run. 

Those files estimate several models of Technical Efficiency.
